- TSV state of local systems, use XSLT with TSV see:

- Server returned an error: HTTP Error 404: project has no repository 'Slackware_14'
  project has no repository 'Slackware_14'
  => don't generate silly requests via OSC for manual local builds
- execute some other command along the build, for example:
  - update build workspaces
  - relocate a workspace
  - clean .ccache (because the software change substantially)
- more robust lock file cleanup:
  - on startup of builder check if .netrc-lock or .global-lock file/dir ist around
    and how old they are. Check if other builders are still running, if not, wipe
    the locks
- allow platform,arch pairs (for instance (Arch_Extra,arm6l) or (Solaris_10,SPARC)).
  Currently all platforms have the same archs.
- eventually check out workspaces befere "de-heading" them. Got weird git errors
  on FreeBSD 9
- provide links to downloadable packages (for internal deployement tests)
- Create images from scratch via description:
  http://www.packer.io/intro
- Use puppet/cfengine to install required packages for
  - building
  - system tests (szenarios with software data, e. g. real customer system with mock data)
- fix hopping slider in log view
- write a module for OSC functions, make sure they survive github outages
- support for other virtualizers:
  - http://cgit.notk.org/gitolite/kvm-wrapper.git/
  - http://codewreck.org/kvm-wrapper/
  - docker?
