  => don't generate silly requests via OSC for manual local builds
- execute some other command along the build, for example:
  - update build workspaces
  - relocate a workspace
  - clean .ccache (because the software change substantially)
- more robust lock file cleanup:
  - on startup of builder check if .netrc-lock or .global-lock file/dir ist around
    and how old they are. Check if other builders are still running, if not, wipe
    the locks
- allow platform,arch pairs (for instance (Arch_Extra,arm6l) or (Solaris_10,SPARC)).
  Currently all platforms have the same archs.
