- Server returned an error: HTTP Error 404: project has no repository 'Slackware_14'
  project has no repository 'Slackware_14'
  => don't generate silly requests via OSC for manual local builds
- execute some other command along the build, for example:
  - update build workspaces
  - relocate a workspace
  - clean .ccache (because the softare change substantially)
- more robust lock file cleanup:
  - on startup of builder check if .netrc-lock or .global-lock file/dir ist around
    and how old they are. Check if other builders are still running, if not, wipe
    the locks
- more robust git update procedure, updating shell scripts while they are executing
  surely breaks the running script! have a separate git_update.sh scripts which is
  kept fairly simple and doesn't change.
