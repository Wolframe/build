- TSV state of local systems, use XSLT with TSV see:
  http://ajhaupt.blogspot.ch/2013/02/how-to-xml-ify-tab-separated-text-file.html
- more robust lock file cleanup:
  - on startup of builder check if .netrc-lock or .global-lock file/dir ist around
    and how old they are. Check if other builders are still running, if not, wipe
    the locks
- allow platform,arch pairs (for instance (Arch_Extra,arm6l) or (Solaris_10,SPARC)).
  Currently all platforms have the same archs.
- provide links to downloadable packages (for internal deployement tests)
- Create images from scratch via description:
  http://www.packer.io/intro
- Use puppet/cfengine to install required packages for
  - building
  - system tests (szenarios with software data, e. g. real customer system with mock data)
- fix hopping slider in log view
- write a module for OSC functions, make sure they survive github outages
- support for other virtualizers:
  - http://cgit.notk.org/gitolite/kvm-wrapper.git/
  - http://codewreck.org/kvm-wrapper/
  - docker?
- creating VMS
  - check out libvirt
  - check out how to create virtual box images
  - check out how to destroy vms (qemu was just deleting the image files)
  - check out how to use chrooted environments
    - chroot (traditional)
    - systemd-nspawn (modern Linux)
    - jail (FreeBSD), podriere as build system on intel64, builds all versions
      of FreeBSD and IA32 version too
    - Linux Containers
    - cross-compilation (for building ok, but for testing? unit and system testing?)
    - what can we test this way? what not?
- build a specific branch (maybe later if we have more than one main release branch)
